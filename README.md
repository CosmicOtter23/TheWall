# TheWall
## Small trivia game based on BBC gameshow

I made this game in my personal time during the first semester of university. The concept is taken from the BBC gameshow 'The Wall', in which players compete to earn money through a large plinko-style machine. 

When watching the programme, I wondered if it would be possible to recreate the ball dropping mechanic in a virtual 3D environment using Unity. I managed to do this by utilising the engine's in-built physics system. After that, I decided to expand on the concept and make it an actual game in which the player can earn points by answering questions, like they can in the game show. I added scoring to the different places the balls could land kept a running total that would be recorded at the end, which would be increased by answering questions right, and decreased by answering them wrong.

To run the game, go into the 'builds' folder. From here, you will find several builds of the game, the most recent of which will be the best. Download the folder and run the .exe file to play the game.
